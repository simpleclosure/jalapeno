steps:
- see what the shape of response is, test with Postman or write a simple test script
    - definitely need: image, title
    - one other property of my choice
    - simple hover effect
- write a backend route to fetch the images from API, make sure the route has type safety (use Zod to make sure the response matches the schema we expect)
- create an ImageGrid (use client) component that calls the backend route and stores the images in frontend state
- nest that component at the page level (page stays a server component)
